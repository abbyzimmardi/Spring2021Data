You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

**Track #1: Tableau**

<pre class="wp-block-verse">The download is for your personal computer. 
You will need to free up hard drive space and have sufficient memory. In my experience, you need at least 15 gb free hard drive space and 4 gb ram â€“ it will be slow but it will run with that.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.tableau.com_tft_activation&amp;d=DwMCaQ&amp;c=7ypwAowFJ8v-mw8AB-SdSueVQgSDL4HiiSaLK01W8HA&amp;r=wFe5rbay4D-AcVOOSHBOIQ&amp;m=CiRLeC70yKt8pKc6_qVwNK31QJqMFBaZOPO7y66Cv4c&amp;s=TPgb-BBc-GKXuzWWP41EcbTxzoHEIo6mGtMApgQLSZI&amp;e=" target="_blank">Download the latest version of Tableau Desktop here</a>

**R and R Studio**       


<img src="Images/RStudio-Logo-Blue-Gradient.png" width="300" height="100" />
    
    Install R and R Studio.
    
    This is free and open source software. It is not large and doesn't tax the memory a lot. 
    R runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, but this course is designed for the Mac version. 
    If you use Windows, there may be variations in the lessons and instructions. Please see me      for questions.
    
    Installing R is a two-step process: 
    1) Install R, the actual program
    2) Install RStudio, a common interface 

    1) Download the most recent version of R for Mac:         
  https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/bin/macosx/R-4.0.2.pkg

    --If you have a Windows computer, go to: 
  https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/bin/windows/base/R-4.0.2-win.exe

    Accept all of the default settings for Mac.

     2) Install RStudio, the interface we use to manage and create R code. Download the open         source edition of R Studio desktop and follow the prompts to install it.   
   https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

## Wednesday, xxx 

**Agenda**  
      
      Arkansascovid.com
      Intro to Tableau
      Teams
      IRE Conference  IRE20 Conference will be Sept. 21-25 
      Exercises and tutorial

**Same Goal, New Direction**
    
    Our partnership with Arkansascovid.com has changed.
    
    Misty Orpin has asked the Journalism Department to run the website. https://arkansascovid.com/
    
    I said yes.
    
    It's an incredible opportunity for the class and the School of Journalism.
    
    And here is how we will do it.
    
    --The School of Journalism will have a GA and a Graduate Intern dedicated to basic daily update of the site: home page data, key charts, a few key Tweets per day.
    
    --This class will write stories and produce data visualizations based on Arkansascovid.com data. That was our original goal. We will just be doing more and with different tools, primarily Tableau and then R, and in a different way.
    
    And we will be Tweeting and doing podcasts, so that will be new.
    
    Normally, I do not revise the course plan like this after the first day of class. But what an opportunity for all of us!
    
    You and the School of Journalism and Strategic Media will be running a multimedia data site and Twitter feed with 11,000 followers reporting on one of the most important issues facing society.
    
**What is New**   

      This course will emphasize Tableau for the next two months instead of R 
      We will shift to a more limited examination of R in October  
      Tableau is less complex than R   
      Homework assignments will involve Tweeting on the account   

**IRE Conference: Sept. 21-25**

      Fellowship:

      You may need to copy the sheet to your own Google Drive to make it work.
      Let me know what you find out.
      
      2) Use the Austin Wilkins automated feed of ADH data to replicate any of the arkansascovid.com charts.
