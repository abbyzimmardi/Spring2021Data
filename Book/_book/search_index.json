Tableau Story Pitches Arkansascovid.com workflow R Basics Prepare Questions for Misty Orpin What is Wrong With This Picture _________________________________________________________________________________________ Random: My nephew, Nick Wells, on a 40-mile trail run Saturday on Mt Hood in Oregon _________________________________________________________________________________________ Here’s an update I made a lot of progress over the weekend figuring out the automation process to gather and crunch the daily numbers. I will discuss this in class but I want you all to check this short video before class tomorrow. https://video.uark.edu/media/ADH+Data+Flow+to+Arkcovid/0_c6hn4feo After looking at everything, I turned to R to streamline the data gathering and analysis process. So I will be teaching you guys the basic R in tandem with Tableau. They fit hand in hand. For this class, the grading be based on a combination of daily task work to keep the site running and a few assignments that highlight the data skills I want you to learn this semester. Daily Tasks Some combination of these each week: See link to Daily Tasks in Teams Tweeting duties: Prepare and monitor twitter for research requests, feedback, engagement. Draft responses. Post in Teams Data Visualizations Data Maintenance for Site Web design, posting Shorter stories Improvements UATV or other media partnership / appearance Work with another class Tasks TBD Each week you’ll put a report of your activities in the “Daily Tasks” Assignment in Blackboard. Instructions are on that assignment. The grading will be guided by this concept: Make meaningful contributions to the website each week. The term “meaningful contributions” is deliberately vague since we are in an evolving process. I don’t want to set a floor for minimal behavior - I am going to push you pretty hard and want you to multitask effectively. I would view the grading like this: Someone will get less than an A if they don’t communicate or flake out on an assignment. If you demonstrate to me that you are trying, we don’t have a problem. Assignments There are still four in the semester but there will be more flexibility on when they are handed in and what the content will involve. The basic skills I want everyone to learn remain the same: —Carefully reported enterprise stories —Data Visualization in R, Tableau (or Flourish) -R Data Analysis with a basic chart —Major Data Maintenance, Restructuring for Site The R and Tableau instructional material will be delivered like before. I will count on you guys to work through the exercises and gain basic competency. Teams Has Two Standing Documents Posted for Daily Tasks and Story Pitches, which I will discuss below Who Are We? I have done a few media interviews since the announcement Thursday. First, the announcement was met by a great deal of enthusiasm in the community, among senior faculty and the like. A few questions came up. –Will we have the opinions that Misty offered in her Twitter feed? My response is Misty came to her opinions after some very in-depth reporting. My class is oriented towards the Associated Press style of reporting, hard news and analysis. Our posts will be rooted in-depth reporting that is transparent to the readers. –How do we respond to people who ask us Covid-19 questions? If you have the answer and can supply the source, then reply, noting you are speaking for yourself. If you are in doubt, say you don’t know and that you’ll raise the issue for the class. This should serve as a reminder that everyone in this class will be in a social media fishbowl. People may troll us and look in our social media feeds to find things to embarass the project. Keeping your personal social media feeds professional will be important. This is one thing all journalists need to acknowledge. Tasks To Do See document in Teams Suggest a task here. put a comment on it and tag me. If I agree, I’ll add it Story Pitches See document in Teams. If you have a story idea, even if it is not fully developed, put it here and the class can examine and discuss it. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Exercise Arkansascovid.com Tableau Lesson #2 –Notes are in Teams https://wordpressua.uark.edu/datareporting/tableau/ Basic R exercise –Left click on the link below, remove .txt extension, save as all files https://github.com/profrobwells/CovidFall2020/blob/master/Exercises/Intro%20to%20R%208-20-2020.Rmd Second option: If that isn’t successful, then go to the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/profrobwells/CovidFall2020/master/Exercises/Intro%20to%20R%208-20-2020.Rmd –Left Click on document –Save as ALL FILES.

They really allow you to do nice charts, graphs and maps quickly. For me, that means more time for complex data viz and less time in Illustrator or D3. Datawrapper has more baked in map shapes. I tend to generally prefer Flourish these days because they have more customization options and visualization types, but they are both great. It took me a semester or two to get my head around which to use in which situation. Some resources below: Here is some datawrapper training I did for CNS. Datawrapper (the company) has used these videos as well! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmGgzBKcK_M&amp;t=3132s Here is a link to a doc I keep of custom Flourish visualization templates that I like. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSly1_5sk93bc3xhyBu0zGWtmKaX9N_SYeyXesBj5ho/edit I am going to forward you a message from a journalist at the Philadelphia Enquirer that I was talking to. He does some cool maps in datawrapper and has a great workflow for importing your own map shapes. It is worth holding onto for the future. Let me know how I can help! -Adam Adam: Datawrapper has good instructions on how to upload your own map here: https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/145-how-to-upload-your-own-map The general process, or at least the workflow I use, is: Compress your shapefile into a zip archive. Go to mapshaper.org and import your zip archive. Your map needs to use the WGS-84 projection or Datawrapper won’t accept it. To put the map in that projection, hit the spacebar in mapshaper to enter the console, and enter proj wgs84 If you want to use labels for your map’s polygons, you’ll need to set interior points. In the console, enter each “cx=\\(.innerX, cy=\\).innerY” You can also simplify the precision of the polygons on your map (hello, Chesapeake Bay) to drive down the file size of the map you’re about to export. Hit the simplify button at the upper right, check the box for prevent shape removal, hit apply, and drag the slider to the right. I usually simplify down to around 50% and the map looks pretty unaffected. Your results may vary. Hit the export button and choose TopoJSON as the file format. Back in Datawrapper, start a new map project, click the or Upload Map button, and upload your TopoJSON file. From here, the process to finish your map is identical to creating any other Datawrapper map. To go even further with a custom map, you can upload a TopoJSON that has a polygon layer for places like precincts and municipalities, and an outer boundary line layer for things like county or state boundaries. For instance, this election map has 240 municipalities in the much-discussed Philadelphia suburbs, as well as 60-plus wards for the city of Philadelphia. It also needed to have thicker lines to show county boundaries as a reference point for readers, or else all the polygons would be one large blob. Here’s an example using another election map: https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/philadelphia-presidential-votes-suburban-county-ward-map-20201109.html You start by uploading a multi-layer TopoJSON. To do that, import a polygon shapefile and a line shapefile into mapshaper.org. Make sure you apply the correct projection and set the interior points for both layers. After you export as a TopoJSON and bring it into Datawrapper, hit the toggle switch for Additional options (advanced). “Regions” are your polygons and choose “Outer borders” to set the thick boundary lines. Anyway, that’s a new Datawrapper trick that I just picked up for our election maps.

Your work will be marked on the following scale: A+: 100 – 98 A: 97 – 93 A-: 92 – 90 B+: 89 – 88 B: 87 – 83 B-: 82 – 80 C+: 79 – 78 C: 77 – 73 C-: 72 – 70 D+: 69 – 68 D: 67 – 63 D-: 62 – 60 F: Below 60 A - The work is of professional quality (for journalism &quot;professional&quot; track students) or high academic quality (for others). It reflects a depth of research, clarity of writing, and a complete grasp of the main concepts presented in the class. B - The work is good but needs editing or is flawed in one of the categories mentioned above. C – The work is weak, needs major editing or reflects an average understanding of key concepts presented in class. D - Work fails to meet requirements and needs a complete rewrite. F – Unacceptable. Libel: Any story that includes libelous material will result in an F (55 percent). Examples would be if you describe someone as a murderer in your story before he or she is convicted, or if you mistype the name of a convicted murder and thereby implicate someone not guilty of the crime. Remote Class: The course will be taught remotely and synchronously, which means we all meet online at the same time twice a week. Course presentations will be on Zoom. The reporting and assignments and homework will be discussed in Microsoft Teams. Students will write in Google Docs and use Google Sheets and GitHub to manage and organize data. These are all tools used in professional newsrooms. The course will be presented in a flipped format, where homework and watching of pre-recorded video lectures is offline and the class time will be used for collaborative problem solving and discussion. I will record all class sessions. Class Communications: 1) Teams: This platform, widely used for project management, will be the heart of our communications. It&#39;s better than group emails. Students can create their own discussion groups as circumstances warrant. It will serve as a convenient repository for messages and documents as we collaboratively report through the semester. Breaking news and important documents related to our reporting will be distributed in Teams. Teams makes it easier to reach everyone and have more productive discussions. Like email, I will expect a timely reply to a direct query to a student on a particular issue. Many reporting and data problems will be discussed on Teams. Teams is free through your university Office365 account. Download the Teams App through the Office365 suite https://its.uark.edu/communication-collaboration/office365/office365-desktop-apps.php 2) GitHub: This will be the class website, You will see homework assignments and lecture material posted on a dedicated GitHub site, https://github.com/profrobwells/CovidFall2020. Students will share and update data via GitHub. GitHub is a common platform for coding. 3) Blackboard: You hand in most material for a grade on Blackboard. Grades will be posted on Blackboard as will be class recordings. 4) UofA email: On occasion, I will send messages to students via the UofA email accounts about important issues but expect much of our communication will be in Teams. It is your responsibility to monitor Teams for direct messages and check your UofA email. I respond to email quickly, usually within an hour. I stop responding to student email at 9 p.m. Attendance: We will be publishing Arkansascovid.com, so your attendance will be very important. Your colleagues will be relying on you to show up and show up prepared. If for some reason you cannot make a class or a publishing assignment, please let me know as soon as possible so I can arrange for a substitute. The class is being offered during a pandemic, so I will be flexible in the event health issues prevent your attendance. Please follow this basic rule: communicate with me about any absence as soon as you can. Online Etiquette: Let us all resist the temptation to multitask during class and instead be present in the brief time we have together. Unless you are talking, please mute your microphone to eliminate outside noise; headsets or earbuds are a good idea. Show your face. Unless there is some extraordinary circumstance, students must activate their video camera during class time. Lurking off-camera impedes the teamwork necessary in this class. Failure to do so will mean you will be marked as absent and removed from the class session. Course Tools 1) Google Docs / Google Sheets: We will write and edit articles in Google Docs, which permits collaborative writing and editing. Google Sheets will be used to keep track of important data and for project management. 2) Tableau: We may use Tableau, a popular data visualization program, to supplement our work. 3) Flourish: You will learn to build graphics in Flourish. 4) Datawrapper: You will learn to build maps in Datawrapper. 5) WordPress: You will learn to post and format your work in WordPress. You will learn about Data Management. Course Organization Student Experience: We have a wide variety of students with different levels of experience with journalism and data. Track 1: Some of you have little experience. Welcome! There is Track 1 for you. Track 2: Some of you have experience in student media and can turn around daily assignments. There is Track 2 for you. Track 3: Advanced students will be working on a national investigative project with the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland. These three tracks are flexible. Some students may move from Track 1 to Track 2. Others may stay in Track 1 the entire semester. Regardless of you experience, you will be contributing to Arkansascovid.com and assisting with the daily maintenance. Daily Site Maintenance: One of the main homework assignments is the daily update of Arkansascovid, tasks that range from data updates to drafting Tweets and Facebook posts for audience engagement. Additional tasks will be assigned as needed. These tasks will be outside of the scheduled class time. The data update begins between 2 p.m. - 5 p.m. daily, depending on release from the Arkansas Department of Health. The data is then made available to students to produce daily charts and tweets based on the news. A calendar for students&#39; daily work is posted on Teams and will be scheduled two weeks in advance or more. Contact Prof. Wells if you have a conflict and work to find a replacement. Homework: Other homework includes short discussion posts and question prompts based on assigned readings or videos. Weekly Memos: All students must keep track of their weekly activities working on the site and describe their work in a weekly memo. I expect these memos to be written in Associated Press style following standard grammar. A memo would describe what a student did on the daily maintenance, problems identified or fixed, community engagement or presentations. A rubric is attached: XXXX Grading Rubric For Weekly Memos Academic Honesty: Please refer to http://provost.uark.edu/245.php for the academic integrity policy. CEA, Center for Education Access: If you are a student with special needs, contact me personally and as soon as possible. The CEA is at 479-575-3104. I will accommodate students who require assistance. Emergency Preparedness Plan: The university has a new emergency plan; review it at http://emergency.uark.edu/ If I need to cancel class, for whatever reason, I will do my best to notify you by e-mail and notify the journalism office: 479-575-3601.

Your work will be marked on the following scale: A+: 100 – 98 A: 97 – 93 A-: 92 – 90 B+: 89 – 88 B: 87 – 83 B-: 82 – 80 C+: 79 – 78 C: 77 – 73 C-: 72 – 70 D+: 69 – 68 D: 67 – 63 D-: 62 – 60 F: Below 60 A - The work is of professional quality (for journalism &quot;professional&quot; track students) or high academic quality (for others). It reflects a depth of research, clarity of writing, and a complete grasp of the main concepts presented in the class. B - The work is good but needs editing or is flawed in one of the categories mentioned above. C – The work is weak, needs major editing or reflects an average understanding of key concepts presented in class. D - Work fails to meet requirements and needs a complete rewrite. F – Unacceptable. Libel: Any story that includes libelous material will result in an F (55 percent). Examples would be if you describe someone as a murderer in your story before he or she is convicted, or if you mistype the name of a convicted murder and thereby implicate someone not guilty of the crime. Remote Class: The course will be taught remotely and synchronously, which means we all meet online at the same time twice a week. Course presentations will be on Zoom. The reporting and assignments and homework will be discussed in Microsoft Teams. Students will write in Google Docs and use Google Sheets and GitHub to manage and organize data. These are all tools used in professional newsrooms. The course will be presented in a flipped format, where homework and watching of pre-recorded video lectures is offline and the class time will be used for collaborative problem solving and discussion. I will record all class sessions. Class Communications: 1) Teams: This platform, widely used for project management, will be the heart of our communications. It&#39;s better than group emails. Students can create their own discussion groups as circumstances warrant. It will serve as a convenient repository for messages and documents as we collaboratively report through the semester. Breaking news and important documents related to our reporting will be distributed in Teams. Teams makes it easier to reach everyone and have more productive discussions. Like email, I will expect a timely reply to a direct query to a student on a particular issue. Many reporting and data problems will be discussed on Teams. Teams is free through your university Office365 account. Download the Teams App through the Office365 suite https://its.uark.edu/communication-collaboration/office365/office365-desktop-apps.php 2) GitHub: This will be the class website, You will see homework assignments and lecture material posted on a dedicated GitHub site, https://github.com/profrobwells/CovidFall2020. Students will share and update data via GitHub. GitHub is a common platform for coding. 3) Blackboard: You hand in material for a grade on Blackboard. Grades will be posted on Blackboard as will be class recordings. 4) UofA email: On occasion, I will send messages to students via the UofA email accounts about important issues but expect much of our communication will be in Teams. It is your responsibility to monitor Teams for direct messages and check your UofA email. I respond to email quickly, usually within an hour. I stop responding to student email at 9 p.m. Attendance: We will be publishing Arkansascovid.com, so your attendance will be very important. Your colleagues will be relying on you to show up and show up prepared. If for some reason you cannot make a class or a publishing assignment, please let me know as soon as possible so I can arrange for a substitute. The class is being offered during a pandemic, so I will be flexible in the event health issues prevent your attendance. Please follow this basic rule: communicate with me about any absence as soon as you can. Online Etiquette: Let us all resist the temptation to multitask during class and instead be present in the brief time we have together. Unless you are talking, please mute your microphone to eliminate outside noise; headsets or earbuds are a good idea. Show your face. Unless there is some extraordinary circumstance, students must activate their video camera during class time. Lurking off-camera impedes the teamwork necessary in this class. Failure to do so will mean you will be marked as absent and removed from the class session. Course Tools 1) Google Docs / Google Sheets: We will write and edit articles in Google Docs, which permits collaborative writing and editing. Google Sheets will be used to keep track of important data and for project management. 2) Tableau: We may use Tableau, a popular data visualization program, to supplement our work. 3) Flourish: You will learn to build graphics in Flourish. 4) Datawrapper: You will learn to build maps in Datawrapper. 5) WordPress: You will learn to post and format your work in WordPress. You will learn about Data Management. Academic Honesty: Please refer to http://provost.uark.edu/245.php for the academic integrity policy. CEA, Center for Education Access: If you are a student with special needs, contact me personally and as soon as possible. The CEA is at 479-575-3104. I will accommodate students who require assistance. Emergency Preparedness Plan: The university has a new emergency plan; review it at http://emergency.uark.edu/ If I need to cancel class, for whatever reason, I will do my best to notify you by e-mail and notify the journalism office: 479-575-3601.
